Just got out of In the Lost Lands and, man, my head's spinning like a dishwasher on that damn extra-fast cycle. First things first, I didn’t exactly expect to be emotionally drop-kicked by a   today. Figured I’d be sitting there sipping my overpriced soda, maybe sneak in a nap. But NO, of course not. This flick pulls your brain into another dimension faster than you can say “popcorn butter.”

First half of it feels like a unicorn having a midlife crisis. It's so intense, so all over the place — which, funnily enough, made me kind of love it. Maybe I've got issues. The characters are like, part-timely brilliant, part-timely confusing as pierogi on a pizza. Them wandering through lands barely made sense most times, but aren’t we all just glorified ants trying to find our way on a soggy cookie?

> Speaking of soggy, there was something deeply magical, yet wet about those landscapes. Everything seems out to disarm you, like pulling the plug on your bathtub dreams. And there she was, kooky quest master herself, grappling with the meaning behind everything, or nothing, who even knows. 

I totally wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later, just to see if it'll be just as mind-boggling the second time. It's like forgetting where you parked your car but actually finding a second car in the end. WEIRD, but yeah, appealing. Let’s take a moment here though, Meryl Streep. Meryl freakin’ Streep. How does she turn every line into a confusing abstract painting I'd put above my sink? Best part is when she goes off about choices, like is she talking about character decisions or the decision to even make this  ?

setTimeout(function() { alert('Lost yet?' ) }, 1000);

Would I sit through it again right now? Probably not, I’m exhausted — but that’s on me thinking it’d be a casual flix. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you like being confused yet oddly satisfied, I guess. It’s one of those experiences, ya know. Kinda like the time my cousin tried to deep-fry a turkey and somehow ended up with smoked pilaf. Doesn’t make sense, but it happened.
